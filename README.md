# LoginDemo
It is a simple login demo android app where user can register and login to the app and logout.The backend is on Firebase so you have to login to firebase via Firefox and make database and make changes to the code respectively.
Also I havent added all the files and folders as there are a lot of them so use android studios create a project there and add all these files over there
